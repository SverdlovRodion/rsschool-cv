 ## Some information about me
 My goal of completing the courses is to gain a deeper knowledge of Front-End and subsequently find a job as a developer. My strengths are the ability to quickly find solutions to complex problems, the ability to google and understand new material myself. I have no experience in commercial website development, but on an amateur level I studied ReactJS and Bootstrap and wrote my own websites and web applications for myself. I also studied C ++ and wrote labs and term papers in it.
